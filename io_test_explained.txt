The io test works as follows first it loads the registers with the value 
for checking if the enter key was typed, the value of where the start of
the greeting string is at, the value of where the subroutine is located.
The subroutine prints out every character encounter till it encounters 
the end of the string then it returns.  The subroutine is called three
times if the user answers "yes" for printing his/her name.  The first
time the subroutine is used is for the greeting, the second is when the
question is posed to the user if he/she would like their name printed, 
and the third would be printing their name.  This program also makes use
of branch zero and branch unconditional.
